# WARNING! Do not place your translation files here.

Any translation files placed here will be deleted when you update the theme.

## Translating the theme

1. Make a copy of the original `wm_domain.pot` file.
2. You need to rename the coppied file now. The naming convention is based on the language code (e.g. "pt" for Portuguese) followed with underscore and the country code (e.g. "BR" for Brazil). So, the Brazilian Portuguese file would be named as `pt_BR.po`.
3. Use [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/) to translate the file and export (save) it as `MO` translation file format.
4. Upload translated `pt_BR.mo` file into your WordPress language directory, such as `/wp-content/languages/themes/auberge/pt_BR.mo`. Alternatively you can put translations in your child theme: `/wp-content/themes/your-child-theme/languages/pt_BR.mo`.

## Contributing your translations back to the theme
