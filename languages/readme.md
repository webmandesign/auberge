# WARNING! Do not place your translation files here.

Any translation files placed here will be deleted when you update the theme.

## Translating the theme

If you have obtained the theme from **[WordPress.org themes repository](https://wordpress.org/themes/author/webmandesign/)**, please translate the theme by clicking the [Translate Auberge](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-themes/auberge) link in [theme page](https://wordpress.org/themes/auberge/) sidebar.

1. Make a copy of the original `auberge.pot` file.
2. You need to rename the coppied file now. The naming convention is based on the language code (e.g. "en" for English) followed with underscore and the country code (e.g. "GB" for Great Britain). Also, rename the file extension to "po". So, the British English file would be named as `en_GB.po`.
3. Use [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/) to translate the file and export (save) translation also in `MO` translation file format.
4. Upload translated `en_GB.mo` file into your WordPress language directory, such as `/wp-content/languages/themes/auberge/en_GB.mo`. Alternatively you can put translations in your child theme: `/wp-content/themes/your-child-theme/languages/en_GB.mo`.

## Contributing your translations back to the theme
